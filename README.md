SMFMarket
======
Basic market place page hooked into SMF using their SSI.  
This is a fork of [this](https://github.com/xNifty/SMF-Market) that is being redone to focus on cleaner, more efficient code, better design with an emphasis on responsiveness, and overall better quality.

About
------ 
Simple, market style page that is hooked into the Simple Machines Forum Software to make use of their SSI (essentially an API). This will allow the use of user roles to determine who can and cannot perform different actions, controlled directly through the forum software itself.  
  
At this time, this project is on hold, most likely until the stable release of SMF 2.1

Requirements
------
1. Simple Machines Forum Software (this makes use of the SMF SSI)
2. Twig (template engine) 

Important
------
This is not currently in a usable state, so please do not try to make use of it.  The required database tables are not currently provided, but in the future will be included through a database creation portion.
